# Forage

Welcome to my repository showcasing the virtual experiences I've completed through Forage. This repository contains different folders, each dedicated to a specific virtual experience provided by various multinational companies. These experiences have helped me gain practical skills and insights into different industries and roles.

## About Forage

## Virtual Experiences
Each folder in this repository represents a different virtual experience I've completed. Inside each folder, you'll find detailed information about the tasks I completed, my reflections, and the results of my work.

### Completed Experiences

- **[PwC's PowerBI Virtual Internship](PowerBI_by_pwc/README.md)**: This experience introduced me to PowerBI and data visualization. It consisted of 4 tasks, including creating dashboards for different roles within a hypothetical call center company, PhoneNow.
